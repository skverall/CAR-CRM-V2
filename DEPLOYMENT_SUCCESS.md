## ðŸ”§ Technical Achievements

### Database Views as Single Source of Truth
```sql
-- All UI components use these immutable views
SELECT * FROM car_cost_view WHERE id = 'car-id';
SELECT * FROM car_profit_view WHERE id = 'car-id';
SELECT * FROM inventory_view WHERE org_id = 'org-id';
```

### Automatic Overhead Allocation
```sql
-- Three allocation methods available
INSERT INTO overhead_rules (org_id, method, active_from) 
VALUES ('org-id', 'per_car', '2024-01-01');

-- Real-time allocation preview
SELECT * FROM preview_overhead_allocation('org-id', 1000.00, '2024-01-15');
```

### TypeScript API Contracts
```typescript
// Stable interfaces for all endpoints
interface DashboardKPIs {
  profit_total_aed: number;
  avg_margin_pct: number;
  median_days_to_sell: number;
  inventory_counts: InventoryStatus;
}
```
