---

## 1. Fixed Issues

### 1.1 Dashboard Cards Language Switching ✅

**Issue:** Dashboard status cards (total, in_transit, garage, for_sale, sold, reserved) remained in Uzbek when switching to Russian.

**Root Cause:** The dashboard page was a Server Component, but the `Text` component needs to be client-side to react to language changes.

**Solution:**
- Created a new client component `StatusCards.tsx` in `src/app/components/dashboard/`
- Extracted all card rendering logic into this client component
- Updated `src/app/page.tsx` to use the new `StatusCards` component
- Now language switching works correctly for all dashboard cards

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/components/dashboard/StatusCards.tsx` (created)
- `src/app/page.tsx` (updated)

---

### 1.2 Expenses Page 404 Error ✅

**Issue:** Clicking "Xarajatlar" (Expenses) button returned a 404 error.

**Root Cause:** The `/expenses` directory existed but had no `page.tsx` file.

**Solution:**
- Created comprehensive expenses page at `src/app/expenses/page.tsx`
- Implemented full expense management functionality:
  - Summary cards (total expenses, average expense, top category)
  - Top categories breakdown with visual progress bars
  - Full expenses table with sorting and filtering
  - Quick add expense functionality
  - Expense statistics and analytics
- Added all necessary translation keys for UZ and RU languages

**Files Created:**

**Features:**
- ✅ View all expenses with detailed information

- ✅ Filter and sort expenses
- ✅ View expense statistics and summaries
- ✅ Category breakdown visualization
- ✅ Full i18n support (UZ/RU)

---

### 1.3 Reports Page 404 Error ✅

**Issue:** Clicking "Hisobotlar" (Reports) button returned a 404 error.

**Root Cause:** The `/reports` directory existed but had no `page.tsx` file (only `/reports/analytics` had a page).

**Solution:**
- Created comprehensive reports landing page at `src/app/reports/page.tsx`
- Implemented report hub with:
  - Analytics report card (links to `/reports/analytics`)
  - Daily expenses report card (links to `/reports/daily-expenses`)
  - Export section with CSV download options
  - Financial report placeholder
  - Info section about reports
- Added all necessary translation keys for UZ and RU languages

**Files Created:**
- `src/app/reports/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ Central hub for all reports
- ✅ Links to analytics and daily expenses
- ✅ CSV export options for cars, expenses, and incomes
- ✅ Full i18n support (UZ/RU)

---

### 1.4 Settings Button Non-Functional ✅

**Issue:** "Sozlamalar" (Settings) button in Quick Actions was not clickable and had no functionality.

**Root Cause:** The button was just a `<button>` element with no onClick handler or link.

**Solution:**
- Removed the non-functional settings button from the dashboard
- Settings functionality can be implemented in the future when requirements are defined

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/page.tsx` (removed settings button)
